## Code of Conduct
To contribute to RhubarbOS, there are two guidelines that you should follow:
 1. **Be kind.** No matter what, you should be kind to fellow contributors and
    members of the RhubarbOS community. This includes being welcoming, being
    helpful, and avoiding insults, personal remarks, sexism, racism, and
    discrimination.
 2. **Be truthful.** Even though you should always be kind, you should not lie
    or hide the truth to accomplish this. The goal of this project is to develop
    an OS &mdash; side-stepping the truth will make that goal hard to
    accomplish.
